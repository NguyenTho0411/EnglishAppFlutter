      "content": "For thousands of years, devices have been used to measure and keep track of time. The current sexagesimal system of time measurement dates to approximately 2000 BCE from the Sumerians. The Ancient Egyptians divided the day into two 12-hour periods, and used large obelisks to track the movement of the sun. They also developed water clocks, which were probably first used in the Precinct of Amun-Re, and later outside Egypt as well; they were employed frequently by the Ancient Greeks, who called them clepsydrae.\n\nThe Zhou dynasty is believed to have used the outflow water clock around the beginning of the first millennium BCE, dividing the day into 100 intervals. The clock was refined during the Han Dynasty by adding inflow mechanisms. During the Song Dynasty, a water-powered astronomical clock tower was designed and built by Su Song, a polymath astronomer, mathematician, and mechanical engineer. The clock tower had several mechanisms, including a globe, a celestial sphere powered by a waterwheel, and chain drive for transmitting the movement of the wheel.\n\nThe first mechanical clocks were invented in Europe around the start of the 14th century, and were the standard timekeeping device until the pendulum clock was invented in 1656. The invention of the mainspring in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first pocketwatches by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the balance spring was added to the balance wheel in the mid 17th century. The increase in accuracy of the balance wheel and pendulum clock between the 17th and 19th centuries dramatically increased the need for accurate clocks for navigation at sea, as well as for astronomical observations.",

      "title": "Urban Heat Islands",
      "orderIndex": 1,
      "content": "An urban heat island (UHI) is an urban or metropolitan area that is significantly warmer than its surrounding rural areas due to human activities. The temperature difference is usually larger at night than during the day, and is most apparent when winds are weak. UHI is most noticeable during the summer and winter. The main cause of the urban heat island effect is from the modification of land surfaces while waste heat generated by energy usage is a secondary contributor.\n\nThe built environment, including roads, buildings, and other infrastructure, contributes to the urban heat island effect in several ways. Dark surfaces, such as asphalt and dark-colored roofs, have a lower albedo and thus absorb more heat. When these surfaces are heated by solar radiation, much of the absorbed energy is re-radiated as longwave radiation, warming the surrounding air. Additionally, the thermal properties of these materials allow them to store heat during the day and release it slowly at night, keeping urban areas warm after sunset.\n\nAnother factor is the reduction in vegetation within urban areas. Plants help cool the environment through evapotranspiration, a process by which water is transferred from the land to the atmosphere through evaporation from soil and other surfaces and through transpiration from plants. Urban areas typically have less vegetation cover compared to rural areas, resulting in reduced evapotranspiration and less cooling. The geometry of buildings in cities also plays a role by trapping heat and reducing air flow, which can prevent the natural cooling that occurs at night.",

      "title": "The Development of Photography",
      "orderIndex": 2,
      "content": "The history of photography began in remote antiquity with the discovery of two critical principles: camera obscura image projection and the observation that some substances are visibly altered by exposure to light. There are no artifacts or descriptions that indicate any attempt to capture images with light sensitive materials prior to the 18th century.\n\nAround 1717, Johann Heinrich Schulze captured cut-out letters on a bottle of a light-sensitive slurry, but he apparently never thought of making the results durable. Around 1800, Thomas Wedgwood made the first reliably documented, although unsuccessful attempt at capturing camera images in permanent form. His experiments did produce detailed photograms, but Wedgwood and his associate Humphry Davy found no way to fix these images.\n\nIn 1826, Nicéphore Niépce succeeded in taking the first permanent photograph using a camera obscura and a polished pewter plate coated with bitumen, a naturally occurring petroleum tar, which hardens with exposure to light. The photograph required an eight-hour exposure in bright sunshine. Niépce called his process heliography, meaning 'sun drawing.' In 1829, he entered into a partnership with Louis Daguerre to improve the process.\n\nDaguerre continued experimenting and evolved the process significantly. In 1839, after Niépce's death, he announced his daguerreotype process, which required only minutes of exposure in the camera, and produced clear, finely detailed results. The daguerreotype had shortcomings, notably the difficulty of making copies, a trait that made it unpopular for portraiture despite its relatively short exposure time. The process was superseded by the wet collodion process and later the gelatin dry plate process.",
